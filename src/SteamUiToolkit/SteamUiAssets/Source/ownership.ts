// Ownership claims: the one primitive every gate needs and every gate used to hand-roll.
//
// Three ways to change Steam's front-end, and every gate uses one of them. Naming which is not
// decoration — it decides what "installed" means, what a probe may check, and what removal owes:
//
//   FEED A DATA CONSTRUCT   supplyNamespace / withdrawNamespace
//     Give a store the shape it was written against, where the client has none. Nothing is
//     displaced, so removal deletes. Perf, audio.
//
//   ANSWER AN RPC           claimMember / releaseMember  (with rpc.ts)
//     Overlay a method the client already has. Something IS displaced, so removal restores it, and
//     the overlay must carry it — see rpc.ts for the reply shape and the query invalidation that
//     make the answer visible. SteamOS Manager GetState, Bluetooth stubs, the brightness setter.
//
//   REVEAL WHAT IS GATED    claimValue / releaseValue, claimAccessor / releaseAccessor
//     Flip the one flag or getter that hides a surface the client can already serve. Narrow and
//     reversible, and never the platform constant: setting TS.IS_STEAMOS produces the same row
//     while changing unrelated client behaviour everywhere, which is the spoof D16 forbids.
//     Brightness availability, network availability.
//
// A gate changes something the client owns. Three things then have to be true, and getting any of
// them wrong has cost a device session:
//
//   1. It can recognise its OWN work. A probe that cannot tell "already ours" from "someone else's"
//      either refuses forever or overwrites a value that was never ours to change. Worse, a probe
//      that requires the pre-patch condition its own apply invalidates tears the patch down every
//      poll — the self-incompatibility teardown loop, paid for three times (the audio namespace,
//      the network getter, the brightness flag, whose row flickered on a ~25-second cycle).
//   2. It can hand back EXACTLY what was there. Keeping the original only in the installing
//      closure restores `undefined` to a bridge replaced in place, and Steam's `?? true` hooks then
//      keep a row visible after removal.
//   3. Both facts survive a separate CDP evaluation. Probes run in their own call, so the marker
//      must be a string key on the object — a Symbol from this scope is not reachable from there.
//
// Every claim below therefore writes two non-enumerable fields: a marker saying this is ours, and
// the original it displaced. Callers supply their own key names so no existing marker changes
// meaning; a renamed key would orphan the marker a previous build left on a running client.
