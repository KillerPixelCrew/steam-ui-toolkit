/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// One source of truth, because these are agreed across a boundary that cannot check itself. The
/// host embeds them in the injected configuration, the injected script defines the window property
/// under them, and nine separate patches evaluate expressions naming them from the C# side. Every
/// one of those was a separate copy of the same literal, and a copy that drifted would not fail to
/// compile — it would produce a patch whose probe silently never finds the bridge.
/// <para>
/// The suffixes are not decoration. They make the property name unlikely to collide with Steam's own
/// globals or with another tool sharing SharedJSContext, which is the same reason WSGM's injected
/// nodes carry their own marker class and never touch CSSLoader's.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Held as constants rather than injected because WSGM is currently the only host. When the toolkit
/// is extracted these become a value the host supplies once — the shape is already right for that,
/// which is why callers reference this type rather than a literal.
/// </para>
